# Neon Dream Flamingo
This is a 2D side-scrolling endless runner game developed in Godot 3.5.1. It feels like a mixture between Flappy Bird and the old arcade game Joust. [It was released to itch.io March 9th 2023](https://singulocity.itch.io/neon-dream-flamingo).
# Postmortem
Originally, it was going to have a sci fi look to it, but as I was developing it, I decided on using DOS-88's music, as well as mixing in Joust so you can run across obstacles. Joust had giant ostriches and vultures running around. With my music selection, I thought flamingos would be appropriate. I wanted to pick a synthwave styled color pallete, so I decided on making the game about a dream of a flamingo flying through a city. The obstacles only made sense to be buildings, telephone poles, and billboards.

At first, the billboards were going to be sarcastic but I figured it would ruin the good vibes, so it only says encouraging lines.

When the player hits an obstacle, the music slows down too. I debated taking the game in a darker direction and have the game slowly corrupt over time and turn into a nightmare but again, I figured it would ruin the good vibes I wanted to keep with the game.
